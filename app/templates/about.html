    <p>The Mind Garden exam is based on the ACE III Addenbrooke's test for Mild Cognitive Impairment. The test is made up of 22 questions and the total score is out of 100.
       The exam tests 5 different areas; Attention, Fluency, Language, Memory and Visuospatial ability.  
    </p>
    <p>The test has been split up into four separate modules, which you can take at your own pace. It is recommended once you start a module you finish it, but 
        if you do choose to stop part way through your progress will be saved. However, you will not be able to return to previous questions once you have submitted your answers.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have completed all four modules, your test results will appear under the 'Your Results' tab. If you would like further support 
        or have any concerns about your cognitive health, please visit the 'Support' tab for further inforamtion.
